# refer-a-friend-form-updating
A script to update pre-written email message text with user entered names to help visitors refer their friends more easily.

This script was originally used on the Family Hearing website: https://www.familyhearingcenter.com/refer-a-friend/

You can see a demo there. As the user updates the name fields, the script listens for changes and updates the message accordingly. The user can still edit the message any way they like, but it reduces the effort to share better hearing.
